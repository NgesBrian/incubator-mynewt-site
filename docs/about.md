#Features

Apache Mynewt's open-source embedded software is designed with the following components:

* Mynewt OS: Real-time operating system kernel (Scheduler, Mutexes, Semaphores, etc.)
* Newt tool: Command line package management and build system 
* Hardware Abstraction Layer unifying common MCU features (e.g. GPIOs, High Resolution Timers, PWM interfaces, UARTs, ADCs, etc.)
* Board Support Infrastructure, that defines the framework for building software for various board architectures.
* Image management and upgrade using the secure bootloader, and flash filesystem.
* System configuration that allows collection of logs and statistics for all packages (with filtering options) ranging from OS-level resources such as memory pools, priorities to interface level counters such as packet exchange and queues
* Core dump captures to enable remote diagnosis of device failures and hiccups
* Network protocol stacks 
    * World's first fully open-source BLE 4.2 stack
        * Support for PDUs of up to 251 bytes for high throughput
        * Support for all 4 roles to be run concurrently - Broadcaster, Observer, Peripheral, Central
        * Random addresses for link-layer security
        * Security Manager Protocol
        * LE Secure Connections

#Feature Request

The WISHLIST at the top of the roadmap on [JIRA for Mynewt](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYNEWT/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:roadmap-panel) features all the new ideas awaiting discussion and review. Once the community decides to go ahead with a request, it is scheduled into a release. Generally, effort is made to schedule a requested feature into a particular version no later than 6 weeks prior to the planned release date.

If you have suggestions for a new feature, use case, or implementation improvements, file a JIRA ticket with Issue Type set to "Wish". Introduce it in the [dev@](dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org) mailing list with a link to the JIRA ticket. This assumes you have signed up for an account on JIRA and submitted a request to the dev@ mailing list for your JIRA username to be added to the Apache Mynewt (MYNEWT) project.
